This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries to be installed:

Pandas

Pyspark

Matplotlib

Json

datetine

spark.ml

seaborn

### files
sparkify.inpynb : This file contains all the code on data loading ,processing , exploratory analysis and machine learning predictions.
mini_sparkify_event_data.zip : This is the zipped file of data which contains 128 mb of event data.



### Running Instructions on colab:
1. Run the following commands on colab to clone repository


    !git clone https://github.com/rajeevfromkrec/UdacityCapstoneSparkChurn.git
  
 
2. Run the following command to unzip the data file.
    
    !unzip ./UdacityCapstoneSparkChurn/mini_sparkify_event_data.zip

3. post that you can follow all the code in spakify.inpunb to load, process and generate predictions
